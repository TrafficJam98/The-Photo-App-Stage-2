# The PhotoApp Stage 1


In this project, I am developing a cloud-native application designed to handle image-related operations, enabling users to seamlessly upload, download, and manipulate their own images. My primary focus here is to establish a robust foundation for the application using AWS services and Python. 

Some of the key objectives in this project include:

1. S3 Image Storage: I will implement S3, Amazon's scalable storage service, to efficiently store user-uploaded images. This ensures secure and reliable storage for our users' assets.
2. RDS Database Integration: To manage user accounts and their associated images, I will utilize RDS, specifically MySQL, as our relational database system. This will enable us to maintain organized records of users and their image collections.
3. IAM User and Policy Management: I will leverage AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to create users and define access policies. This ensures that users have appropriate permissions to interact with their images securely.

   
It's important to note that my primary objective is not to create a novel image application; rather, I aim to provide an architectural exemplar for working with assets, which could encompass a wide range of data types, from legal documents to extensive financial datasets. Our project serves as a practical demonstration of how to architect and implement asset management within a cloud-native environment.

Note: This code is for display only. In order for it to run correctly, one has to set up his/her own AWS enviroment
